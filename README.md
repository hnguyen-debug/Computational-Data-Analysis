This project analyses global box office data alongside economic and population trends to understand factors driving movie revenue and to predict future performance. 
The analysis leverages datasets including:

Box Office Data (2000–2024): Worldwide, domestic, and foreign revenue, movie ratings, vote counts, genres, and production countries.
GDP Data (2000–2024): Country-level economic indicators.
Population Data (2000–2024): Country-level population statistics.
